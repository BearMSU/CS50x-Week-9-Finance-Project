# CS50x-Week-9-Finance-Project
This is my CS50 Week 9 finance project. It's basically a web app/interface that allows a user to login/create a login and password and then buy and sell stocks.
The stocks are real and pulled from yahoo.

Each person is granted $10,000 to start with and the balance will very on how they buy and sell. There is also a history section to show what they have bought and sold over time.

Again, this was a homework assignment. Some of the flask was already created and setup in app.py. Most of the functions I had to build.
All of the HTML pages were self built.

If you are using this for your week 9 homework assignment, use this as a guidepost. Please attempt to do on your own first. It's the only way we learn as developers. If you get stuck, feel free to poke around. Enjoy!
